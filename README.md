# Tomorrow Theme
After having spent several years using, tweaking and refining a personal editor theme since 2005, I decided it was time to publicly release "Tomorrow Theme" on the _14th of February 2011_. Tomorrow theme is a colourful theme with muted colours and sensible syntax highlighting.

A theme should aid your work by providing easily identifiable colours that add meaning and enhance legibility. This was the main focus when developing Tomorrow Theme.
